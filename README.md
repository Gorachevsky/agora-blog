# Blog AGora

This is my first attempt to generate my own blog. The following technologies are involved in this development:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the React framework
- [Next.js API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) for server-side API routes as the backend
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as the ORM for migrations and database access
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) for authentication
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) as the CSS framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as the programming language
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for deployment
